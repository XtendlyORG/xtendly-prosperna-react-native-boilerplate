## Requirements 🎒

Node 12 or greater is required. Development for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode 10 or up.

You also need to setup your [development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

## Using the boilerplate 💻

To create a new project using the boilerplate simply run :

```
npx react-native init AppName --template https://github.com/JericoK/xtendly-prosperna-react-native-boilerplate
```

## Running the project 📲

Assuming you have all the requirements installed, you can run the project by running:

- `yarn start` to start the metro bundler, in a dedicated terminal
- `yarn start:<platform>` to run the _platform_ application (remember to start a simulator or connect a device)

🚧 It's a Work In Progress section 🚧
